English title
No new same-day AI announcements from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google AI/DeepMind (official channels)

English factual summary
A check of OpenAI’s official news and release-note pages shows no AI-related announcements dated 2025-12-21; the most recent official items remain earlier posts such as GPT‑5.2 system card updates and prior ChatGPT release notes. Anthropic’s official news and research sections likewise list announcements and research updates up to November and mid‑December 2025, but none with a publication date of 2025-12-21. Google’s AI and DeepMind–related official blogs, including Google Research and broader technology AI posts, also show AI updates only through mid‑December 2025, with no entries dated 2025-12-21.​

Why it matters
For teams that rely on these primary official sources to track concrete changes in models, safety policies, and flagship AI products, the lack of same-day announcements indicates there are no newly confirmed updates that must be incorporated into deployments, documentation, or governance on this date. This helps keep today’s decisions anchored in already-published information and avoids reacting to secondary reports or speculation that have not yet been reflected in official channels.

截至 2025-12-21（UTC），OpenAI、Anthropic 与 Google AI/DeepMind 官方渠道均无当日新的 AI 公告

为什么重要
对于依赖这些一级官方来源来跟踪模型更新、安全政策和核心 AI 产品变动的团队而言，当日没有新的正式公告，意味着在这一日期无需根据新增信息调整现有部署、文档或治理安排。这样有助于确保当日的决策仍然建立在已公开的官方信息之上，避免因尚未在官方渠道体现的二手报道或推测而作出反应。
